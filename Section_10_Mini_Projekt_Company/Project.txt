Intro

Welcome to the Mini Projekt - Company section!


In this part, we will create a simple database that will support a small software house. For the sake of exercise,
let's call it "esmartdata". What are we going to need? What tables do we need to create? What kind of relationships
to use?


Ultimately, our database will consist of four tables:
    - "esmartdata_user"
    - "esmartdata_developer"
    - "esmartdata_tech"
    - "esmartdata_developer_techs"


The table "esmartdata_user" will store information about the users of the software house. The "esmartdata_developer"
table will be an extension of the "esmartdata_user" table and will store additional information for software developers.
We will store all common information (first name, last name, etc.) for developers and users in the "esmartdata_user"
table. We will store developer specific information (experience, known technologies) in the "esmartdata_developer"
table. For this purpose, we will use a one-to-one relationship between these tables.


The table "esmartdata_tech" will store the names of the technologies that are used in the software house. One developer
may know many technologies. One technology may be known by multiple developers. For this purpose, we will use the
many-to-many relationship. The "esmartdata_developer_techs" table will be the bridge table to store the relationship
data between the "esmartdata_developer" and "esmartdata_tech" tables.


Good luck!
