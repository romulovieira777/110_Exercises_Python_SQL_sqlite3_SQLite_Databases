Intro

Welcome to the Project - Forum Application section!

In this part, we will create a simple database that will support the forum application. For the sake of exercise,
let's call it "app". What are we going to need? What tables do we need to create? What kind of relationships to use?

Ultimately, our database will consist of four tables:
    - "app_user"
    - "app_thread"
    - "app_comment"
    - "app_group"
    - "app_group_user"

The "app_user" table will store information about forum users. The "app_thread" table will store information about
forum threads. The "app_comment" table will store information about comments in the forum. The "app_group" table will
store information about user groups in the forum. The table "app_group_user" will be a bridge table to store data about
the relationship between tables "app_group" and "app_user". In this case, we will use the many-to-many relationship
between these tables.

One user can have multiple threads on the forum. One thread can have multiple comments. One user can belong to many groups.

Good luck!
